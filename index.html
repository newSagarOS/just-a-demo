		<p>Hi I am Sagar Pandey. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Dublin City University, Ireland. This webpage gives an intro about how my life has evolved from the scratch.<br>
		So, I am an inquisitive student of a very young age of <strong>28 years</strong> fighting in this pandemic as the most of us trying to figure out why is this pandemic affecting me(again like most of us). I wonder in the night when I'm about to sleep that why is this happening to me, what have I done to deserve this pandemic. I finished my masters degree from Ireland while sitting at my home from one bed to another and to table sometimes. How's that for a Degree? Then I convince myself that there is still long way to go and as per the famous quote <strong>I have miles to go before I sleep(quite literally)</strong> and keep on exploring the endless possibilities in the back of mind till I think it's time for some sane people to wake, so wow now I should SLEEP!!</p>
